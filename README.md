# User-Auth-App
Practice application that implements user auth.
This app lets a user sign up with a username and password, and also sign in and sign out. 

While the user is signed in, the user is able to access a route that is only available while signed in.

The main NPM packages used to accomplish this are passport, passport-local, passport-local-mongoose, body-parser, mongoose, express and express-session.
